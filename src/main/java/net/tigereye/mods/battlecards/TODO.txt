TODO:Mixin ProjectileEntity, implementing BattleCardsProjectile
TODO:Mixin ProjectileEntity, hooking onEntityHit, onBlockHit, onCollision, and tick

To hook into projectiles, or to replace them with lookalikes? Existing projectiles come with existing effects,
for good and ill. I'd like snowballs to extinguish targets. I don't want arrows always doing full arrow damage.
Perhaps I can just overwrite the 'on hit' functions entirely, and reimplement the parts I want.
Specifically, put hooks at the start of the various trigger functions.
Actually, PersistantProjectileEntities have easily customized damage. so just set that to zero and handle it myself.


Cards will drop in Booster Packs, which will usually be related to the dropping mob.
Likely, any mob can drop a generic pack. That way killing modded critters is still worth something.

This mod is problably just going to be the core mechanics and projectiles and such. Content will be provided in Sets

TODO:Make CardEffects and BattleCardProjectiles NBT serializable. bleh... gonna put this off, see if its actually a problem.
