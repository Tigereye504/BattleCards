To hook into projectiles, or to replace them with lookalikes? Existing projectiles come with existing effects,
for good and ill. I'd like snowballs to extinguish targets. I don't want arrows always doing full arrow damage.
Perhaps I can just overwrite the 'on hit' functions entirely, and reimplement the parts I want.
Specifically, put hooks at the start of the various trigger functions.
Actually, PersistantProjectileEntities have easily customized damage. so just set that to zero and handle it myself.
Or I could say 'fuck it', have all projectile cards throw cards, and just upgrade the snot out of the card projectile

TODO: fix deck breaking with second stack of matching card
TODO: make modifiers usable in CardScalars
TODO: determine why knockback acts funny
TODO: allow non-sweeping attacks

Cards will drop in Booster Packs, which will usually be related to the dropping mob.
Likely, any mob can drop a generic pack. That way killing modded critters is still worth something.

This mod is problably just going to be the core mechanics and projectiles and such. Content will be provided in Sets

If stuff starts acting strange, consider:
Make CardEffects and BattleCardProjectiles NBT serializable.

TODO: Make Cards (Mostly card art, now)!

--Card Sleeves and Damage Values--
sleeveless cards should be akin to stone weapons, while netherite-sleeved cards should be akin to enchanted netherite weapons
quick effects should be somewhat weaker than the balance point, and charge effects better (based on mana cost)
stone swords do 5 damage, enchanted netherite does 11.
leather cards should have some advantage; the material is sub-iron damage, but is less available.
damage becomes more effective point-for-point as it bypasses more armor, but you also need more
to reach new breakpoints where you kill in fewer hits.

--Balance Considerations: Quick Actions--

(1 point = 1 mana gain equivalent)
2-1 point budget for cards with no or a trivial delivery method (target self, block, any ally-targeting effect)
2+1 point budget for cards with a simple delivery method (sweeping melee, basic projectile)
2+2 point budget for cards with a minor drawback (cumbersome delivery, simple delivery + a brief self-debuff)
cards *must* require non-trivial delivery or have a significant cost to pay out mana,
 and should do something to targets.
 (something like Life Tap: lose life, gain mana could be acceptable. Mana Tap: melee, just gain mana would not.)
similarly, cards generally should produce at least 1 mana if they require delivery.

--Balance Considerations: Charge Actions--
Charge actions likely won't come up against a single average mob; they just aren't tanky enough.
So charge effects are for multi-mob fights, consecutive fights, or major fights.
Attack charges should a minor foe outright, maim a major foe, or maim multiple minor foes to feel impactful.
As such, charge attacks generally shouldn't do less damage than a Strong, single hit.
Charge actions, naturally, are better than quick actions due to costing mana.
So a 1 cost charge action should be worth around 3 points, plus 0-2 for targeting as with quicks.
A budget of 2 + targeting mod + mana cost, then.
should payout be 1-1 mana for points? Maybe.
  That would mean a 5-mana simple delivery skill has 8 points to spend.
  'Kill' designed for diamond spends 5 mana on 'extremely strong' damage, with 3 for secondary effects.
  'Kill' designed for iron instead spends 6 on 'deadly' damage with 2 for effects.

Costs for charge effects:
With 2 'weak and 2' attacks on a mob at iron or diamond, that leaves 3-4 mana to spend on a 'Strong and effect' finisher,
  like Cannibalism.
With 3 'weak and 2' attacks killing a mob at diamond, that leaves 5-6 mana to spend on a second kill.
  So 5-6 mana single targets will want 'extremely strong' damage, if intended to just kill.
With 4 'weak and 2' attacks killing a mob at iron, that leaves 7-8 mana to spend on a second kill.
  So 7-8 mana single targets will want 'deadly' damage, if intended to just kill.
With 5-6 'weak and 2' attacks killing a mob at paper...
  get out of paper, or specialize with 'mid and 1's or 'weak and 3 and cost's!

A cap of 10 mana would fit this system, encouraging players to spend once they have enough for payout
  while leaving room for combos of lesser charge attack or using 'setup' charge attacks

On events:
Two types of event listener: 'persistant' listeners and 'instanced' listeners.
persistent listeners would listen to every card played
instanced listeners would be created at the start of, only listen for, and die at the end of a card play
I don't have a good way to know once a card is done with all its effects, though,
as projectiles and delays detach from the original execution
Well, a PersistantCardEffectContext is already planned.
Put the listeners in that and just iterate though it come event time
