--Card Design: Point Buy--

Quick and Charge actions are both fundamentally balanced around the same idea: they only have so many mana points to spend.
A mana point, as the name implies, is worth 1 mana. The starting budget a card has at base is determined by its delivery method:

1 mana point for cards with no or a trivial delivery method, such as self, block, auto-aiming, or ally-targeting effects.
3 mana points for cards with a simple delivery method such as most projectiles
4 mana points for cards with more difficult delivery, such as melee or cumbersome projectiles.
Exceptionally troublesome delivery methods may be worth even more base points.

Each mana spent on a card's charged action increases its budget by 1.

If a card applies negative effects to the user, those effects add to that card's budget rather than the cost.

--Quick Actions--

A quick action never costs mana, and so only have access to base and drawback mana points.
The primary purpose of a quick action is generally to produce mana, though some eschew that to just have a moderate effect.
Mana is taken, not generated. Card *must* harm, drain, or destroy something to pay out mana.
Something like Life Tap: lose life, gain mana could be acceptable. Mana Tap: melee, just gain mana would not.

Quick actions generally should produce at least 1 mana if they cause harm
Quick actions generally should be of the same nature as it's charged action, but exceptions exist.

--Charge Actions--

Where quick actions produce mana, charge actions spend it. They are better than quick actions due to costing mana.

Cost targets for charge effects:
1-2 cost:
    Simple utility effects. There's not enough mana here to do much of interest, but 'not much' is not 'nothing'.
    If these do damage, it should not be more than 'strong' else at netherite they become petty one-shots.
3-4 cost:
    Charge actions intended to be used on a common mob that took one or two quick attacks.
    These charge actions should generally do 'strong' or greater damage to finish the target off.
5-6 cost:
    Charge actions intended to be used after killing a mob with 3 diamond quick actions.
    These charge actions should generally do 'extremely strong' or greater damage to kill a second target.
7-8 cost:
    Charge actions intended to be used after killing a mob with 4 iron quick actions.
    These charge actions should generally do 'deadly' or greater damage to kill a second target.
9-10 cost:
    These charge actions are too expensive to merely slay one common enemy.
    Be they killers of giants or of armies, they need to be devastating to justify their use.

*'light' and 'very weak' damage should only be for special cases, like multi-hits, 'pinpricks', or advantaged damage types
** cards should not hit this hard without extreme conditions.
** These values are mostly for determining the cost of advantaged damage types.

When inflicting a variable amount, use the average expected result.
If a card does damage to the same target multiple times, sum the damage instances together to determine the mana point value.

Damage types that bypass defenses are valuable in modded PvE, and devastating in PvP. As such they are more expensive.
The below multipliers do not apply to self-harm, which generally should use modify_health or piercing damage anyway.
Damage Type         Effective Damage Multiplier
Armor Piercing      x1.5
Protection Piercing x2
AP+PP               x4
modify_health*      x2 (be it for healing or for harm)
*while not damage per se, it has the same end result. It is cheaper than AP+PP because it doesn't scale with sleeves.
*this applies

--Status Effects--

A status effect's cost is measured in terms of its duration modified by its magnitude.

Increasing the magnitude by 1 doubles the duration-value of that status effect.
If a status effect gains nothing from increased magnitude, don't change the effective duration.

Some status effects are significantly more valuable than average.
In such cases, apply a multiplier to their duration-value.
Status Effect       Duration-Cost Modifier
Blindness           x16 (While largely useless against mobs, this is an utterly crippling status to players.)
Evasion             x32 (This is outright invulnerability by means of removing the user's hitbox.)
Levitation          x12 if hostile, x1 on user (This is a powerful CC effect, much nastier than slowness.)
Mining Fatigue      x2 (Low magnitudes aren't too bad, but high magnitudes effectively disable mining entirely.)
Nausea              x8 (This is a frustrating interface screw, and disables sprinting.)
Poison              x4 (Damage over time is potent stuff. We all hate cave spiders for a reason!)
Regeneration        x3 (Slow healing, but indeed still healing.)
Wither              x3 (Less than poison? Yep. Wither can kill, buts it's also very slow.)

When applying multiple status effects, sum together the duration of the effects to be applied.

Finally, use the duration-cost to find the mana cost of the card's status effects.

Duration-Value      MP Cost
100 ticks (5 sec)   1
300                 2
600                 3
1200 (1 minute)     4
+1200               +1

Status effects that do damage (or healing) very quickly are instead calculated as damage.
Damaging Status     Effective Damage Multiplier
Instant Damage      9 damage-cost, x2 per magnitude
Instant Healing     8 damage-cost, x2 per magnitude

Finally, effects intended to provide *momentary* (10- ticks) super-defense always cost 1 MP
This includes effects like Evasion or high magnitude Armored/Resistance.

--Block Placement--

<TBD>
Likely similar to status effecting? Lacks sleeves, so should be more cost-efficient.

--Other Effects--

Healing is handled the same as damage via modify_health; x2 healing amount as damage-cost.
Lifesteal is healing that enjoys damage scaling but contends with defenses, and so is worth the same as the damage it is attached to.
Absorption apart from the status effect is equal to healing if it doesn't stack with itself, twice as much if it does.

Effects that restore hunger or saturation are priced x1/2 that of healing, as it is very easy to... just eat.

Pushing is usually only worth a point , unless it is such you must account for falling damage (which is AP damage).


--Other Considerations--

If a card has conditions that must be met to have an effect, that effect is cheaper.
For example, requiring the target to have a status effect (or one of a few status effects) generally halves the cost.
More or less stringent conditions are worth more or less of a discount, respectively.

If a card applies both damage and status effects, card sleeves (which roughly double card strength) will be less efficient at empowering it.
Determine the mana points spent on damage and status effects (including damaging status effects).
Discount the less expensive category by 50%. If they are equal, just pick one to be the 'most expensive'.

If a card applies to multiple targets, increase the cost by 1 for every 2 targets expected on average beyond the first.
For example, sweeping melee attacks are generally worth +1.

Finally. if a card's effects prove exceptionally synergistic or counter synergistic then adjust the price accordingly.
These costs are guidelines to keep cards balanced, not ironclad rules to be min-maxed or slavishly obeyed.
